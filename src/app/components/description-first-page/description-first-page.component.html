       <p> Regular consumption of vegetables and fruits protects the body from many diseases. Consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits not only because of their organoleptic qualities, flavor creates true culinary delights but at the same time they have a special phytotherapeutic role. As food they are particularly tasty, they have a low number of calories and fats, they are easy to prepare, and from the point of view of the impact on the health of the body, they are especially important, preventing the appearance of many very serious diseases . Diseases that can be flattened by eating vegetables and fruits are: different types of cancer, coronary heart disease and concussion, just to name a few.</p>
       <p>Recent scientific research has confirmed that the most colorful vegetables and fruits contain the most nutrients. In other words, a brightly colored product is richer in vitamins, minerals and nutrients than another in the same species, or from different species that have a paler coloring. Red, orange or yellow vegetables and fruits contain many carotinoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-cryptoxantine) or phenols (an antioxidant). The green color is the color that indicates that we have a lot of chlorophyll. One experiment showed that red grapes contain far more phenol than white grapes, out of 80 grams of grapes, the phenol content is 296 mg for red grapes and only 155 mg for white grapes. Potassium, another very important element, is found in almost all vegetables and fruits. Magnesium is found in all green vegetables and fruits, also indigenous and also in bananas. This is particularly important in the fight against high blood pressure. Carotinoids and vitamin C are found in brightly colored fruits and vegetables are found in red, yellow, orange. Carotinoids and vitamin C strengthen the immune system and help the body fight free radicals. Water-soluble dietary fiber is a support of the heart and circulatory system, also a means of preventing diabetes, and water-insoluble dietary fiber helps the digestive system in digestion and eliminates metabolic residues in the body. Fruits and vegetables are carbohydrates. </p>
        <p>Bodybuilders, on the other hand, do not need carbohydrates because they have heard that ... they do not do well in beauty. As such, the proportion of carbohydrate-based dietary intake and muscle mass have existed for decades. The question arises, whether a low carbohydrate diet is associated with loss of muscle mass? Many sports medicine doctors recommend eating carbohydrates, otherwise muscle mass loss would occur. </p>
